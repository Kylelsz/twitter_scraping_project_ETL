Working on the same repository in GitHub can be done through the following steps:

1. Fork the repository you wish to work on. This will create a copy of the repository under your own account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command git clone <repository URL>

3. Create a new branch for your changes using the command git branch <branch name>

4. Checkout to the newly created branch using the command git checkout <branch name>

5. Make the changes you wish to make to the code and test them locally.

6. Commit the changes to your local repository using the command git commit -m "Commit message"

7. Push the changes to the remote repository using the command git push origin <branch name>

8. Create a pull request on the original repository to merge your changes with the master branch.

9. The owner of the original repository will review your changes and merge them if they are satisfied with them.

10. Once the changes are merged, your branch will be deleted and you should be able to see the changes in the original repository.

Note: It's always good practice to always work on branches instead of working on the main branch. This allows for better code reviews and also reduces the risk of data loss.
